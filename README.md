# Neural_Image_Caption_Generator

This project aims to build an Image Caption Generator using Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing. The idea for this project has been roughly taken from - Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator by Oriol Vinyals, Alexander Toshev, Samy Bengio and Dumitru Erhan. The paper can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4555v2.

The dataset used this project was Flickr8K from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/shadabhussain/flickr8k). It consists of 8000 images (divided into train, dev and test sets) with around 5 captions for each image. This dataset can be found in the directory Neural_Image_Caption_Generator/data.
